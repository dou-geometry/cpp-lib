# Dynamic System Sinmuation Research

## Initial State
A discrete jump from 0 to 1 at fluid interface. 

---

# System modeling

## Known Points

1. Acceleration towards higher existence
2. Positive correlation between energy/mass with existence

## Definitions

### Constant velocity (no force acting)

Given $v$, for any space with existence エ, it means traveling $vエ$ per unit time.

## Components

### Degradation (Consumption v.s. Radiation)

This part decides given two point (A, B) seperate by distance $D$, given A's original existence エ, how much will B perceive?

- Time-dependent linear consumption
- Spatial-dependent linear consumption

- Ratio-based radiation

Radiation proposed a significant issue that it couldn't handle cases where D->0 (which is kinda a common occuring case within our theory).

Also a question to radiation-based degradation is that, then does the Existence being consumed? Like with time-dependent linear consumption where over time the existence decreases (at least for carrier).

### Spaton

- Finite Spaton => resulting infinite range of gravitational effect (and perhaps preserving conservation of energy?)
- Infinite Spaton

### How traveling is experienced

### Weight (for integration)
