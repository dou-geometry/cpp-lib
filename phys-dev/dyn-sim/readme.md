# Dynamic System Sinmuation Research

## Initial State
A discrete jump from 0 to 1 at fluid interface. 

---

# System modeling

## Known Points

1. Acceleration towards higher existence
2. Positive correlation between energy/mass with existence

## Definitions

### Constant velocity (no force acting)

Given $v$, for any space with existence エ, it means traveling $vエ$ per unit time.

## Components

### Consumption

- Time-dependent linear consumption
- Spatial-dependent linear consumption

### Radiation

### How traveling is experienced

### Weight (for integration)
